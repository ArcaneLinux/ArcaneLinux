Arcane Linux (I just call it Arcane, tbh) is a custom Arch Linux install that will be game ready out of the box. This is mainly for my purposes. It was put together so I can ust install Arch without needing to constantly be reinstalling everything all at once. Yes, I know I could just write my own deploy script, but this should be much easier in the long run. Work smarter, not harder...
